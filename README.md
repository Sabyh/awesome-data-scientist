# awesome-data-scientist
A repository dedicated to provide a roadmap for prospective Data Science practitioners as well as maintaining resources about Data Science for beginners, intermediate as well as advanced practioners.

## Table Of Content  

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind this repository was so that beginners in the field of Data Science will be able to find their way through the path towards becoming a Data Scientist. In today's information age, it is very easy to get lost in the vast amount of content available online. This repository will help navigate through this information by providing a structure towards learning Data Science.

## Path to becoming a Data Scientist

This section will try to develop a path towards becoming a Data Scientist. 

We will assume about a **24 month** window for this. 

Depending on your starting point, you can choose where to start from. Even if you are an intermediate Data Science practioner, I would highly recommend going though this path from the start.

The roadmap presented in this repo isn't a-one-size-fits-all type of curriculum. Some of you coming from CS/Math/Statistics backgrounds may choose to cherry pick some resources while discarding others. This is perfectly okay. üëçüèº

## Beginner (3-6 Months)

Start here if you are a complete beginner to Data Science. or if you have recently completed an introduction to Machine Learning course like the one offered by Microsoft Azure on Udacity.

### Learn Python

Perhaps the most well known book published about practical Machine Learning, Aurelien Geron's masterpiece provides an impressive coverage of two of the most beloved Machine Learning libraries.

Note that for the above book, it is advisable to read upto Part 1 initially. This will cover the scikit-learn library.

We can move to part two in the next 6 months which involves Deep Learning with Tensorflow.

## Intermediate (6-12 Months)

At this stage, you will be comfortable working with Data Science libraries and different datasets. Now, we will be moving into slightly more advanced topics like Deep Learning.

### Learn Deep Learning Concepts and Libraries

[**_free-link-ebook_**](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/yury/AAI/Textbook/Deep%20Learning%20with%20Python.pdf)


Another book written by the author of a famous library, Deep Learning with Python offers a deep-dive into the famous Keras library. 

Note that there is a newer version of the book set to be released which will cover the use of Keras in Tensorflow 2.0.

### Learn Deep Learning and Machine Learning Math (Optional)

This section is left optional because these books will take a lot of effort to read and understand. There is a lot of math involved within the content of these books but it really helps to understand what is really happening underneath the Machine Learning libraries that we have learnt so far.

![Deep Learning](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/large_book_cover/http/mitp-content-server.mit.edu%3A18180/books/covers/cover/%3Fcollid%3Dbooks_covers_0%26isbn%3D9780262035613%26type%3D.jpg?itok=opJUfdCT)

[**_free-ebook-link_**](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

The most famous book about Deep Learning, it is a must read for all Deep Learning enthusiasts. Although there is significant mathematics presented in the topic, the approach is easy to grasp.

![elements-of-statistical-learning](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41TmbdP0EZL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

[**_free-ebook-link_**](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf)

Another very famous book that focuses on the mathematics behind classical machine learning models, The Elements of Statistical Learning is a classic.

### Project 2 

Depending on how soon you have completed the material (excluding the optional section), you might want to considering building another project at this point. 
You can pick either a classical ML project or a Deep Learning one. 

## Advanced (12-18 Months)

At this stage, you would have sufficient knowledge about the breadth of the field of Data Science and Machine Learning. There are a couple of paths one could take here depending on the interests and goals.

### Project 3 and/or 4

These projects could be domain specific such as:
*  Computer Vision
*  NLP
*  Reinforcement Learning 

### Data Science Competitions

Look up competitions that are happening in websites like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [Hackerearth](https://www.hackerearth.com/), [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/) and join and participate! If you are in college, you could also look at college level Data Science competitions as well.

### Implementing a research paper

This is technically also a project but in this case, you will be specifically taking a research paper of interest and trying to implement the concepts presented in it. 
This is definitely the hardest among all of the three tracks mentioned here. However, having a research paper implementation project in your resume is pretty awesome as it will help you stand out from the crowd.

## Professional/ Job Ready (18-24 Months)

This section will focus on making you a really well rounded Data Scientist. By now, your resume should have atleast 2-4 Data Science projects. 
In these sections, we will try to cover the remaining aspects of landing that Data Science job.

### Learning and Practicing SQL
Many roadmaps may include this step at the start. However, the reason I include this at the end is because I feel the best way to learn SQL is to practice it. Post this stage, most of you will be lining up interviews for Data Science positions. Most companies will have a round of SQL questions in their interviews. Hence, by practicing it now, your practical concepts will remain fresh.

**Courses**

* [Intro to SQL by Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-sql) (Recommended)
* [Advanced SQL by Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-sql) (Recommended)

**Practice**

*  [SQL Zoo](https://sqlzoo.net/) (Recommended)
*  [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql) (Recommended)
*  [SQL Fiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com/) (Optional)

### Data Structures and Algorithms

Again, one of those topics that a lot of roadmaps either choose to include in the initial stages or discard entirely. Eitherways, having a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms is very important. 

Data Science roles may not test these concepts as hard as a Software Engineering role. However, most FAANG companies as well as a lot of startups do ask a round of coding interview questions even for Data Science roles.

If you are from a CS background, you will most likely be familiar with all the topics presented here.
