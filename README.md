# awesome-data-science
A repository dedicated to maintaining resources about Data Science for beginners, intermediate as well as advanced practioners

## Table Of Content  

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind this repository was so that beginners in the field of Data Science will be able to find their way through the path towards becoming a Data Scientist. In today's information age, it is very easy to get lost in the vast amount of content available online. This repository will help navigate through this information by providing a structure towards learning Data Science.

## Path to becoming a Data Scientist

This section will try to develop a path towards becoming a Data Scientist. 

We will assume about an **24 month** window for this. 

Depending on your starting point, you can choose where to start from. Even if you are an intermediate Data Science practioner, I would highly recommend going though this path from the start.

Some of you coming from CS/Math/Statistics backgrounds may choose to cherry pick some resources while discarding others. This is perfectly okay. üëçüèº

## Beginner (3-6 Months)

Start here if you are a complete beginner to Data Science.

### Learn Python
