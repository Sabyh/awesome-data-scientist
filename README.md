# awesome-data-science
A repository dedicated to maintaining resources about Data Science for beginners, intermediate as well as advanced practioners

## Table Of Content  

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind this repository was so that beginners in the field of Data Science will be able to find their way through the path towards becoming a Data Scientist. In today's information age, it is very easy to get lost in the vast amount of content available online. This repository will help navigate through this information by providing a structure towards learning Data Science.

## Path to becoming a Data Scientist

This section will try to develop a path towards becoming a Data Scientist. 

We will assume about an **24 month** window for this. 

Depending on your starting point, you can choose where to start from. Even if you are an intermediate Data Science practioner, I would highly recommend going though this path from the start.

Some of you coming from CS/Math/Statistics backgrounds may choose to cherry pick some resources while discarding others. This is perfectly okay. üëçüèº

## Beginner (3-6 Months)

Start here if you are a complete beginner to Data Science. or if you have recently completed an introduction to Machine Learning course like the one offered by Microsoft Azure on Udacity.

### Learn Python

### Learn the Mathematics

**Khan Academy**

* [Statistics and probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)
* [Calculus 1](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1)
* [Calculus 2](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-2)

**Kaggle Notebooks and/or Project 1**

At this point which should be around the 2-4 month mark, you should be able to start working on Kaggle. By this, I do not mean competing in competitions. 

Kaggle users post datasets on which EDA notebooks can be created by other users. With your knowledge of Python, you can start creating these notebooks and gain popularity in the Kaggle community. 

You may also start working on exploratory data analysis based projects where you find a dataset of your interest and do some data analysis on it.

### Learn Machine Learning Concepts

Note that for the above book, it is advisable to read upto Part 1 initially. This will cover the scikit-learn library.

We can move to part two in the next 6 months which involves Deep Learning with Tensorflow.

## Intermediate (6-12 Months)

At this stage, you will be comfortable working with Data Science libraries and different datasets. Now, we will be moving into slightly more advanced topics like Deep Learning.

This book makes a second appearance here. This time, you would want to read the second part of the book which is focused on Tensorflow.

### Learn Deep Learning and Machine Learning Math (Optional)

This section is left optional because these books will take a lot of effort to read and understand. There is a lot of math involved within the content of these books but it really helps to understand what is really happening underneath the Machine Learning libraries that we have learnt so far.
